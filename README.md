# Mall_Customers_KMeans_Task8 
This is Task 8 of my AI/ML Internship. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups using unsupervised learning.

##  Task Objective:
- Apply K-Means clustering
- Use Elbow Method to find optimal K
- Visualize clusters and centroids
- Evaluate using Silhouette Score

##  Dataset:
- Source: [Mall Customers Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- File: `Mall_Customers.csv`

##  Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  Steps:
1. Loaded and cleaned data
2. Encoded gender and selected relevant features
3. Used Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters
4. Trained K-Means model and predicted labels
5. Visualized clusters and centroids
6. Evaluated using Silhouette Score
